# Auto Requirement Matrix

This is a small utility that will take in a [yaml file](http://docs.ansible.com/YAMLSyntax.html) ([Like this one](https://github.com/justgage/Auto-requirement-matrix/test.yaml)) and turn it into an HTML table showing which design entities satisfy which reqirements. This was written in [Go](http://golang.org).
