# UPDATE: I created a program to convert the old matrix into this one (although not a way to automatically merge them yet) I’ve pasted in a bunch make sure to double check them. 
# This is the is the place you should write your traceability requirements
# NOT the sheets file! Please look over the structure to get an idea of how
# things are organized. It can be converted to HTML, Markdown and CSV
# currently. Here’s an example of what it will look like in the end: 
# http://justgage.github.io/Auto-requirement-matrix/reqirements.html 
# 
# All formatting will be gone after it’s rendered so
# feel free to do as much of that as you want.
# 
# everything after a “#” are comments and won’t effect the matrix when 
# rendered.
#
# Tricky things: 
# make sure that there is a space after “:”s
# example: 
# foo: <- notice the space
#  - a list item
